# Importing modules

Most apps share common needs, like profiles, notifications, or roles management.

p2p Shipyard comes with a **collection of plug-and-play modules** to fulfill these common needs, which you can see in the menu on the left.

Each module provides a back-end and a front-end side with **lego-block-like components**: integrate and customize them to get most of what your need in your app.

Go ahead and explore the documentation for the modules that you find interesting, to see which ones you need to import in your app.

Did you find what you need? Awesome! Go ahead and import them using the instructions of each specific module.
